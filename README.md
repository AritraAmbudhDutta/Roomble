Roomble
==================================

This full-stack web application is made as a course project of [CS253](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/Courses/sdo25.shtml/): Software Development and Operations in Spring 2024 under the guidance of [Prof. Indranil Saha](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/).

Roomble is an integrated property rental and flatmate matching application which seeks to solve the common problems faced by young newcomers to metro cities. Users are classified into 2 different categories - tenants and landlords. 

The platform simplifies the process of finding suitable rentals and appropriate flatmates with the following salient features -

### For Tenants:
* Search properties efficiently by location, price range, amenities, and more
* Find compatible flatmates using our smart recommendation algorithms and compatibility score
* Message landlords/flatmates directly within the platform
* Rate and review properties and flatmates after interactions

### For Landlords:
* List properties with detailed descriptions and photos
* Manage property availability and tenant inquiries
* Receive reviews from verified tenants

The interface of the web app is simple and intuitive ensuring that users will not face any difficulties while using the application and will have a seamless experience.
